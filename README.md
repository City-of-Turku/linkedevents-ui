=====================================================

Linkedevents-UI is a user interface for creating and changing events through
Linked Events API. It exposes many capabilities of the API including:

* Creation, changing and deletion of events
* Managing multipart events
* Showing available actions based on user permissions

# Prerequisites
* Yarn
* Node v14 LTS 

# Theming

Linkedevents project supports theming. 
If there's a need to style components differently to match a certain city's branding,
a theme npm package will be used to override any default styles.

Here's a link to a city theme example with a README on how to start using it: https://github.com/codepointtku/linkedevents-ui-theme

# Development Installation

Copy the contents of `config_dev.json.example` to `config_dev.json`.

`config_dev.json` contains partially working settings giving you read only
access to our test API. If you have your own API and/or authentication
credentials you can change the relevant settings therein.

The UI is now compatible with the `courses` extension for the Linked Events API.
If you wish to include the extra fields specified in the `courses` extension,
please change the `ui_mode` setting from `events` to `courses`.

## Running development server

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

Then point your browser to the webpack dev server at http://localhost:8080/.

# Production installation

For production builds, all configuration is done using environment
variables. This way, no errant configuration files should cause mysterious
build failures or, worse, dormant configuration errors. The environment variables
are named exactly the same as the ones in `config_dev.json`. For example,
if you'd like to change the base address for Linkedevents API, you would:
```
export api_base="https://testilinkedevents.turku.fi:8001/v1/"
```

## Building

After setting the config you can build install dependencies and build the
static files:
```
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

You should now have the bundled javascript + some non-bundled assets in
`dist`. You can serve these using your favorite web server at whatever
address suits your fancy.

# Building with Docker

In order to build linkedevents successfully, make sure you have Docker setup correctly for your operating system:(https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
As well as your config file: `config_dev.json`

Once you have everything setup, you can run the build command in the directory:
```
docker build -t linkedevents-ui .
```

## Running with Docker
You can use Desktop Docker to run the container or run it manually by using the command:
```
docker run -dp 8080:8080 linkedevents-ui
```
